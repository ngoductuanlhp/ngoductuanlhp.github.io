Hi! I am an AI Research Resident at [VinAI Research](https://vinai.io/), advised by Dr [Khoi Nguyen](https://khoinguyen.org/). Prior to that, I received my B.E. degree in Computer Engineering from the [Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology](https://hcmut.edu.vn/), Vietnam.

My primary research interest is about Computer Vision, specifically in 3D Understanding. Given a scene represented by various kinds of 3D data, my ultimate research question is to understandthe geometry as well as the semantic meaning of each location in the scene, giving rise to a holistic understanding of the scene.

This is my [CV](/assets/pdf/CV.pdf).
