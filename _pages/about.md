Hi! I am an AI Research Resident at [VinAI Research](https://vinai.io/), advised by Professor [Luu Anh Tuan](https://tuanluu.github.io/). Prior to that, I received my B.E. degree in Computer Engineering from the [Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology](https://hcmut.edu.vn/), Vietnam.

I am broadly interested in demystifying deep learning and developing reliable machine learning systems. Currently, I am focusing on explaining the adversarial examples phenomenon and improving adversarial robustness. I am also interested in generative modeling and the applications of causal inference.

This is my [CV](/assets/pdf/CV.pdf).
