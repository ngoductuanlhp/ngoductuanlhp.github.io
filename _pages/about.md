Hi! I am an AI Research Resident at [VinAI Research](https://vinai.io/). Prior to that, I received my B.E. degree in Computer Engineering from the [Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology](https://hcmut.edu.vn/), Vietnam.
 <!-- advised by Dr [Dung Duc Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xV7uHJgAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Hoang-Anh Pham](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sGPFOAYAAAAJ&hl=en). -->

My research interests are in the field of computer vision, with a specific focus on 3D understanding. I am developing algorithms and techniques for understanding the geometry and semantics of 3D scenes, with applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality.

This is my [CV](/assets/pdf/CV.pdf).
